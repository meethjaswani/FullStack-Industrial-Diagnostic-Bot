For the given diagnostic query, create a step-by-step execution plan using ONLY the available tools.

{'CONVERSATION CONTEXT (Previous Analysis):' if conversation_context else 'NEW CONVERSATION:'}
{conversation_context if conversation_context else 'This is the first query in the session.'}

CURRENT QUERY: "{user_query}"

Available Tools (ONLY THESE):
- SCADA: Access real-time sensor data (pressure, temperature, vibration, RPM, load, error codes)
- MANUAL: Search technical manuals and troubleshooting procedures

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
1. Each step MUST start with either "SCADA:" or "MANUAL:"
2. ONLY create steps that these tools can execute
3. DO NOT create analysis, synthesis, or comparison steps (another agent handles that separately)
4. Maximum 3 steps total
5. For follow-up questions, consider what was already analyzed in previous turns

FOLLOW-UP QUESTION GUIDANCE:
- If user asks "what about X from my last query" ‚Üí Focus on the specific aspect X
- If user asks "check the trends we discussed" ‚Üí Query relevant historical data
- If user asks "compare with previous results" ‚Üí Get current data for comparison
- If user asks "what else should I check" ‚Üí Suggest additional diagnostic steps

Query: "{user_query}"

Good Examples:
- "What is the pressure in March?" ‚Üí ["SCADA: Get March pressure readings"]
- "How do I fix a pump leak?" ‚Üí ["MANUAL: Search for pump leak repair procedures"]
- "Pressure is high, what should I do?" ‚Üí ["SCADA: Check current pressure readings", "MANUAL: Find high pressure troubleshooting procedures"]
- "What about the temperature data from my last query?" ‚Üí ["SCADA: Get current temperature readings for comparison"]
- "Check the pressure trends we discussed earlier" ‚Üí ["SCADA: Get historical pressure data for trend analysis"]

Bad Examples (DON'T DO THIS):
- "Analyze the pressure data" ‚ùå (Analysis is not a tool)
- "Compare SCADA vs Manual results" ‚ùå (Comparison is not a tool)
- "Determine root cause" ‚ùå (Analysis is not a tool)

SCADA Tool Can Do:
- Get current sensor readings
- Query historical data
- Check error codes
- Retrieve measurements

MANUAL Tool Can Do:
- Search for procedures
- Find troubleshooting steps
- Look up safety protocols
- Find maintenance instructions

Create a logical plan with 1-3 steps that ONLY use these tools for data gathering.
Consider the conversation context when planning follow-up questions.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object like this example:
